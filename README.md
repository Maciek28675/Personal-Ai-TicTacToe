# 2D Tic Tac Toe Game with minimax algorithm
This project was written in Java using Swing GUI library.
The Structure follows MVC architecture. I've tried my best
to write the code as clean as possible and to follow SOLID principles. <br />

The application lets user choose bot's difficulty (which is maximum depth of minimax algorithm)
, start and restart the game at any time and view communicates. <br />

## How to compile and run
Works both on Windows and Linux. <br />
in your chosen directory follow this steps:

```cmd
mkdir bin
javac -d bin src/Main.java src/model/*.java src/view/*.java src/controller/*.java
java -cp bin Main 
```

## User Interface
Simple flat UI with modern color palette
